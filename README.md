## Overview

This is a simple and user-friendly Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to get real-time weather information for any location by fetching data from a weather API. The app provides current weather conditions, temperature, and other relevant details, making it easy to stay informed about the weather.

## App Functionality

1.  **Location Input:** Users can enter the name of a city or any other location into the provided search bar.
2.  **Weather Data Fetching:** Upon submission, the app sends a request to a weather API to retrieve the latest weather data for the specified location.
3.  **Real-time Information Display:** The fetched weather data is then processed and displayed to the user, including:
    - Current temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit).
    - Weather description (e.g., "Clear sky", "Scattered clouds").
    - Humidity.
    - Wind speed.
    - Potentially other relevant details like pressure or sunrise/sunset times (depending on the API response).
4.  **Error Handling:** The app includes basic error handling to inform users if the location is not found or if there's an issue fetching the weather data.
5.  **Clean and Intuitive Interface:** The app features a straightforward and easy-to-understand user interface for a seamless experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Provides the structural elements for the app's interface, including input fields and display areas.
- **CSS:** Styles the app to create a visually appealing and organized layout, ensuring readability of weather information.
- **JavaScript:** Handles the core logic of the app, including:
    - Interacting with the weather API (making asynchronous requests).
    - Processing the API response data.
    - Dynamically updating the HTML to display the weather information.
    - Implementing basic error handling.

## Getting Started

To run this Weather App locally:

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/I-SatyamPrashar/Weather-App.git](https://github.com/I-SatyamPrashar/Weather-App.git)
    cd Weather-App
    ```
2.  **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.**

   The Weather App should be visible and ready for you to enter a location.

**Note:** This app relies on a third-party weather API. You might need to sign up for an API key from a weather data provider (like OpenWeatherMap) and include it in the JavaScript code (`script.js`) for the app to function correctly. Ensure you handle your API key securely and do not expose it publicly.
